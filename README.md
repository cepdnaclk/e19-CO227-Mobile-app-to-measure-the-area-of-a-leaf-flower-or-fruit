## <a id="1-introduction"></a>🚀 Introduction

- The crop department of agriculture faculty is expecting to use a mobile app to measure the area of a leaf, flower or fruit.Through advanced image analysis algorithms, AgroCam precisely calculates areas, catering to the irregular shapes often found in nature. Our user-friendly interface guides you through the process, making it accessible even to those new to digital measurement techniques.

## <a id="2-features"></a>🌟 Features

- Plant Identification: Utilize image recognition algorithms to identify plant species from scanned images.
- Geolocation Integration: Implement geolocation services to determine the location where the image was captured.
- Database Integration: Integrate with plant species databases to retrieve additional information about identified plants.
- Leaf Area Detection: Develop algorithms to accurately measure leaf area from images.
- Report Generation: Automatically generate detailed reports including plant species, leaf area measurements, and location data.
- Cross-Platform Sharing: Enable sharing of generated reports across various platforms such as email, messaging apps, and social media.
- User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive interface for easy navigation and seamless user experience.
